### Analysis of LandMacharia Epidemiological Data

***


This project is about LandMacharia, a fictional country whose basic facts are outlined below. It was a class assignment issued for the Research Methodology course I was undertaking at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in June 2018. The course was taught by Dr. Lucy Ochola, a research scientist at Institute of Primate Research, Kenya (IPR). 

This data analysis project was done in groups of two in the class and my colleague was Jennifer Mutisya.

The motivation behind creating this repository is to learn how Git and GitHub can be used in Open Science for collaboration and in reproducible and replicable research. Although we did not use Git and GitHub for collaboration in the project, I was motivated to learn how we could have done the data analysis in a collaborative and reproducible manner. This was especially fuelled after attending the [Open Science Workshop](https://bioinfonet.github.io/OpenScienceKE/) held at KENET Training Lab, Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Library, University of Nairobi in August 2018. Git and GitHub and RStudio which were some of the tools for open science covered in the workshop, have been used in this project.






#### WELCOME TO LANDMACHARIA

***

Landmacharia is unfortunately experiencing a resurgence in TB and what is described as Polio-like paralysis disease. Lately there has been a boom in the population in the rural area, and the government has not been able to keep up with economic development in this area, despite the consistent rains and bountiful food supplies. Due to this, there has been a sudden influx of people into the main cities (especially Mkwendaville and Gesareton) in search of a better jobs. But this has caused great problems of crowding, poor sanitation and nutrition.

Landmacharians are known for their innovative, adventurous, and collaborative approach to health systems.  It was challenging to share data with the HIV/AIDS program, the Diabetes program, and the prison sector at first, but things were sorted out eventually and now there is mutual trust and timely sharing.  While this is great for the country and for the program, it is sometimes a challenge for the M&E Officer, Dr. G. Kenneth who is responsible for making sense of all this data that is flowing in and out. 

Daktari needs help to validate the quality of these data, create graphs, interpret and hence draw conclusions.  Fortunately, you have been flown in as a special consultant to Landmacharia to assist him.

Your report will be in the following general format:

* Title
* Background information - where you outline all the issues you noted with the data
* Results - Graphs, Pie Charts e.t.c.
* Discussion/Conclusion and Recommendations

He has prepared some basic facts for you to help you get a handle on the task ahead.

*Good luck!*
